# Water-Trap-Visualizer
Built an interactive web app to compute and visualize the amount of water trapped between blocks of varying heights.  

DATA PIPELINE: Input block heights → Compute trapped water (Trap Rain Water Algorithm) → Per-index water calculation → SVG Visualization → Interactive Frontend  

FEATURES: 
- Computes total trapped water and per-index water units.  
- Visualizes blocks and water using **SVG graphics**.  
- Interactive controls: Compute, Load Example, Clear.  
- Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS — no external dependencies.  

TECH STACK: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | SVG | Frontend Visualization  

IMPACT:Converts raw height data into a visual and quantitative understanding of water trapping. Great demonstration of algorithmic thinking and frontend visualization skills.
